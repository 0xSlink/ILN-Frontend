# Contributing to ILN Frontend

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Invoice Liquidity Network (ILN) frontend! This guide will help you get started with development, testing, and submitting contributions.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher (recommended: Node.js 20 LTS)
- **npm**: Version 9 or higher
- **Git**: For version control

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork the [ILN-Frontend repository](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Frontend)
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ILN-Frontend.git
   cd ILN-Frontend
   ```
3. Add the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Frontend.git
   ```

**Note for Fork Contributors**: This repository uses a custom self-hosted GitHub Actions runner (`namespace-profile-nursca`) that is not available to forks. If you are working from a fork, you will need to modify workflow files to use GitHub-hosted runners (`ubuntu-latest`) instead. See [docs/ci-cd.md](docs/ci-cd.md) for details.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

The `prepare` script runs `husky` automatically, registering the hooks in `.husky/`.

### What the hooks do

| Hook         | Trigger      | Action                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pre-commit` | `git commit` | Runs `eslint --fix` and `prettier --write` on staged files only      |
| `pre-push`   | `git push`   | Runs `tsc --noEmit` to catch type errors before the branch is pushed |

Hooks are scoped to staged files via `lint-staged`, so they typically complete in well under 10 seconds.

### Skipping hooks (not recommended)

If you genuinely need to bypass a hook in an emergency:

```bash
# Skip pre-commit only
git commit --no-verify -m "your message"

# Skip pre-push only
git push --no-verify
```

Do not make a habit of skipping — the same checks run in CI and will block your PR.

### Editor configuration

A `.editorconfig` file at the repository root gives every editor a consistent baseline (2-space indentation, LF line endings, UTF-8, final newline) before Prettier runs. Most editors support it natively or via a free plugin — see [editorconfig.org](https://editorconfig.org) for setup instructions.

### Prettier configuration

Formatting rules live in `.prettierrc.json`. Files and directories excluded from formatting are listed in `.prettierignore`.

To format the entire codebase manually:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

---

### 3. Environment Variables Setup

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Required environment variables (see [README.md](README.md) for full list):

#### Stellar & Smart Contract Settings

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID` - Invoice factoring smart contract ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` - Stellar network passphrase
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` - Soroban RPC server endpoint
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_NAME` - Network name (TESTNET/PUBLIC)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK` - Network type (testnet/public)
- Token IDs for USDC, EURC, and XLM

#### Backend Services

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase database URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Resend email API key (server-side)
- `CRON_SECRET` - Secret for cron job security

#### Feature Flags

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_ENABLED` - Enable Invoice NFT metadata display
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSURANCE_POOL_ENABLED` - Enable liquidity insurance pooling
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MOCKING` - Enable MSW mocks for local development

### 4. Stellar-Specific Setup

#### Install Freighter Wallet

1. Install the [Freighter wallet extension](https://www.freighter.app/) for your browser
2. Create or import a Stellar account
3. Switch to the appropriate network (Testnet for development)

#### Get Testnet Funds

If working on Testnet, fund your account using the Friendbot:

- Visit [Stellar Testnet Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org/)
- Enter your Freighter wallet address
- Receive 10,000 XLM for testing

#### Configure Network in Freighter

1. Open Freighter extension
2. Go to Settings
3. Select "Testnet" network
4. Ensure your account is active on the selected network

### 5. Explore the Component Library with Storybook

All shared UI components are documented in Storybook. Browse them locally:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

A Storybook is also deployed to GitHub Pages on every merge to `main` — check the repo's Pages link for the latest published version.

### 6. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Development Workflow

### Pre-Push Checklist: `pnpm run verify`

Before pushing a branch or opening a PR, run:

```bash
pnpm run verify
```

This runs the same checks as CI, in the same order, in a single command: `lint` → `env:check` → `i18n:check` → `format:check` → `tsc --noEmit` → `test`. A passing `pnpm run verify` locally means the CI `lint` and `tests` jobs will pass too, so use it instead of running each check separately to avoid round-trips on avoidable CI failures.

### Issue and PR Assignment Policy

Issues that are assigned to a contributor are expected to move forward promptly. If an issue remains assigned without a linked PR update for 7 days, the repository automation will post a reminder comment. If the issue still shows no linked PR activity after 14 days, the assignee is automatically removed so the issue can be claimed by someone else.

The thresholds and message text are configurable through the workflow inputs and repository variables used by [.github/workflows/stale-assignments.yml](.github/workflows/stale-assignments.yml). Contributors should keep assignments current, open or update a linked PR early, and unassign themselves if they can no longer work on the issue.

### Before Proposing Architecture Changes

Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) first. Some questions have already been decided, and reopening one without that context wastes review time:

- **GraphQL**: the frontend reads data over REST, Soroban RPC, Horizon, and the indexer's REST/WebSocket endpoints. The decision to adopt, defer, or drop GraphQL is made in [#929](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Frontend/issues/929) and recorded in the status section of [docs/graphql-query-guidelines.md](docs/graphql-query-guidelines.md). Read both before proposing a GraphQL client or layer.

### Data Fetching and React Query Architecture

For full architectural specifications, key factories, caching defaults, and mutation patterns, consult the canonical **[Data-Fetching Architecture Guide](docs/data-fetching-architecture.md)** and **[Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md)**.

To ensure consistent caching, loading states, and bundle efficiency across the application:

1. **Centralized Query Hooks**:
   All contract data and network fetching logic must be encapsulated inside custom React Query hooks under `src/hooks/queries/` (or `src/hooks/`).

   - Direct `fetch()` calls and direct `useQueryClient` / `QueryClient` usage are **disallowed** inside UI component files (`src/components`, `src/screens`, `src/app`).
   - An ESLint rule in `eslint.config.mjs` flags direct `fetch` and `useQueryClient` imports/usages in component files outside `src/hooks`.

2. **Shared Default Query Configuration**:
   All query hooks build on `DEFAULT_QUERY_CONFIG` / `createQueryConfig` exported from `src/hooks/queries/defaultConfig`:

   - `staleTime`: Default 30,000ms (30 seconds)
   - `gcTime`: Default 5 minutes (300,000ms)
   - `refetchOnWindowFocus`: Default `false`
   - `retry`: Default `2`

   Documented per-hook overrides (such as custom `staleTime` or `refetchInterval`) are permitted via `createQueryConfig({ ... })` when genuinely justified by data volatility.

3. **Exception Process**:
   In rare cases where direct `fetch` or `useQueryClient` is genuinely required inside a component (e.g. an isolated user feedback form submission or app-level reconnect banner):
   - Add an inline ESLint disable comment above the line:
     ```typescript
     // eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-syntax, no-restricted-imports -- Legacy inline exception or client-only action
     ```
   - Provide a concise comment documenting why a custom hook in `src/hooks/queries` was not used.

### Type Safety: `as any` Casts

Bare `as any` casts silently defeat TypeScript and were the source of a 60+ instance backlog (see #908, #909, #910, #911). New unjustified casts are blocked by the custom `local/require-as-any-justification` ESLint rule in `eslint.config.mjs` (backed by `eslint-rules/require-as-any-justification.mjs`).

1. **Prefer a real type first.** Before reaching for `as any`:
   - Extend the domain interface (e.g. add an optional field such as `Invoice.whitelist` or `last_activity_ledger` instead of casting around its absence).
   - Narrow `unknown` payloads (Soroban `scValToNative` results, Horizon event topics) with `typeof` / `in` checks and `Record<string, unknown>`.
   - Model optional third-party surface explicitly (e.g. `FreighterWindow`, `TokenAvailability`) and use `as unknown as T` for stubs rather than `as any`.
2. **If the cast is genuinely unavoidable** (a real third-party type gap such as an untyped `@stellar/freighter-api` experimental method or a `recharts` tooltip formatter signature), document it with a justification comment on the **immediately preceding line**:

   ```typescript
   // as-any justification: @stellar/freighter-api does not type the
   // experimental `addTrustline` wallet method, so we cast the module
   // namespace to reach it. Remove once upstream types include it.
   // See https://github.com/stellar/freighter/issues/...
   await (freighter as any).addTrustline?.({
     assetCode: token.symbol,
     assetIssuer: token.contractId,
   });
   ```

   The comment must state the specific type-system limitation and, where one exists, link the upstream issue/type-definition gap. The lint rule errors when this comment is missing.

3. **Scope:** the rule is `error` in production code and `warn` in tests/stories/`__tests__` (test doubles and DOM stubs legitimately need loose casts). Keep test casts minimal and typed where cheap to do so.

### Code Style and Formatting

We use **ESLint** and **Prettier** to maintain consistent code quality.

#### Linting

```bash
# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting errors
npm run lint:fix
```

#### Formatting

```bash
# Format all files
npm run format

# Check formatting without modifying files
npm run format:check
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

We recommend using Husky for pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended):

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
```

Add to `package.json`:

```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}": [
    "eslint --fix",
    "prettier --write"
  ],
  "*.{json,md}": [
    "prettier --write"
  ]
}
```

### Testing

#### Unit Tests (Vitest)

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Update snapshots after intentional UI changes
npm test -- --update-snapshots
```

#### Test File Organization

This codebase currently has two coexisting test location conventions. Both are
intentional and supported - use the one that matches what you're testing:

1. **Colocated `__tests__/`** - next to the module under test, e.g.
   `src/hooks/__tests__/useFoo.test.ts` for `src/hooks/useFoo.ts`, or
   `src/components/governance/__tests__/Bar.test.tsx` for
   `src/components/governance/Bar.tsx`. This is the default for unit tests of a
   single hook, util, or component: `src/utils/__tests__`, `src/lib/__tests__`,
   `src/hooks/__tests__`, and the various `src/components/**/__tests__` folders all
   follow this pattern, as do `app/offline/__tests__` and
   `app/pay/[id]/__tests__` for route-level components.
2. **Centralized top-level `__tests__/`** - for suites that don't map 1:1 to a
   single source file: cross-page or integration-style tests, and grouped
   cross-cutting concerns in a named subdirectory, e.g. `__tests__/contract/`
   (on-chain/contract integration tests), `__tests__/accessibility/` (per-page a11y
   audits, `*.a11y.test.tsx`), and `__tests__/error-boundaries/`. Fixtures shared
   across these live in `__tests__/fixtures/`.

**When adding a new test**, prefer colocation (1) if it exercises a single
hook/util/component in isolation. Use the centralized directory (2) if it's an
integration suite spanning multiple modules/pages, or belongs to one of the
existing grouped concerns above - add a new named subdirectory under `__tests__/`
rather than a new flat top-level file if you're starting a new cross-cutting
concern.

Note: a number of component tests still live as flat files directly under
`__tests__/` (not colocated) from before this convention was documented. Those are
**not** being mass-moved as part of documenting this convention - this section
only governs where _new_ tests should go. Bulk migration to colocation is a
candidate for a future dedicated issue.

#### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests in headed mode (for debugging)
npm run test:e2e -- --headed

# Run specific test file
npm run test:e2e -- invoice-submission.spec.ts
```

#### Visual Regression Tests (Storybook + Chromatic)

```bash
# Start Storybook locally
npm run storybook

# Build Storybook
npm run build-storybook

# Run Chromatic visual tests
npm run chromatic
```

### Commit message format

This repository uses Conventional Commits to power changelog generation via `git-cliff`.

- Commit messages should follow the format: `<type>(<scope>): <short summary>`.
- Use the types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
- Example: `chore: add CHANGELOG and git-cliff automation for frontend repo`
- After adding release-worthy commits, update the changelog with:
  ```bash
  npm run generate:changelog
  ```

## Branch Naming Convention

To maintain consistency and enable automated tooling, all branches should follow the Conventional Commits prefix convention:

- `feat/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks (dependencies, tooling, etc.)
- `perf/` - Performance improvements
- `test/` - Test additions or modifications
- `ci/` - CI/CD configuration changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (no functional changes)

Examples:

- `feat/add-invoice-submission-form`
- `fix/stellar-wallet-connection`
- `docs/update-contributing-guide`
- `chore/upgrade-dependencies`

This convention aligns with our commit message format and helps with changelog generation.

## Pull Request Requirements

### Before Submitting a PR

1. **Code Quality**:

   - Run `pnpm run verify` (lint, env:check, i18n:check, format:check, tsc --noEmit, test) and ensure it passes — this mirrors CI exactly
   - Run `npm run lint:fix` to fix all linting errors
   - Run `npm run format` to ensure consistent formatting
   - Ensure zero ESLint warnings

2. **Testing**:

   - Run `npm test` and ensure all tests pass
   - Run `npm run test:e2e` for critical user flows
   - Add tests for new features or bug fixes
   - Maintain test coverage above thresholds (90% lines, 90% functions, 80% branches)

3. **Visual Changes**:

   - If your PR includes UI changes, run `npm run storybook`
   - Ensure Storybook stories are updated or added for new components
   - Chromatic will automatically run visual regression tests on your PR

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update relevant documentation (README, DESIGN.md, architecture docs)
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update TypeScript types if needed

### Closing issues that claim a mock was replaced

A merged PR's `Closes #…` keyword automatically closes the issue whether or not the diff does what the issue says. Governance write paths were once closed as "live" while still returning `Math.random()` fake hashes and in-memory mock mutations because PR #670 was merged with `Closes #651 / #652 / #653` without manual or automated verification of the write paths. See the [governance mock-closure retrospective](docs/governance-mock-regression-retrospective.md) and [frontend mock closure audit](docs/frontend-mock-closure-audit.md) for full context on this motivating incident.

To prevent recurrence, the following process controls are mandatory:

- **PR Template Checklist Item (Process Control)**: Every PR template requires explicit confirmation of two items before merge:
  1. _Mock-Replacement Verification_: If the PR claims to close an issue saying "replace mock", "implement real", or "wire live", both author and reviewer must confirm that the specific mock pattern (e.g. `Math.random()` fake hash, in-memory mock state mutation, unused signer parameter, `MOCK_*` array stub) is completely removed in the diff.
  2. _Linked-Issue Behavior Verification_: Reviewers must verify that the actual behavior change described in the linked issue is present in the PR diff, not just that CI is green.
- **Authors:** only use `Closes` for issues the diff fully resolves. Use `Refs #…` for partial work, and state explicitly in the description which sub-claims remain open.
- **Reviewers:** check which checks actually ran on the PR. A PR with no test workflow in its checks list has no CI signal.
- For contract-integration functions, record the function as `'real'` using the mock-backing detection helper ([docs/testing.md → Mock-backing detection](docs/testing.md#mock-backing-detection)).
- If the PR changes a status doc (e.g. `docs/contract-integration-status.md` or `docs/mock-inventory.md`), the doc and the `Closes` lines must agree. If the doc still says **Stubbed** or **Mock**, the issue stays open.

### Issue and PR Title Conventions (Implementation vs. Planning/Documentation)

Issue titles like "Replace X mock with live integration" read as done-when-closed, which caused severe confusion when closed by planning or documentation PRs. All contributors and maintainers must adhere to the following title conventions (Issue #855):

| Category            | Allowed Title Prefixes / Verbs                                                               | Usage Guidelines & Merge Requirements                                                                                                                                            | Examples                                                                                                                    |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Implementation**  | `feat:`, `fix:`, `Implement real <X>`, `Replace <X> mock with on-chain <Y>`, `Wire live <X>` | **Only** for PRs and issues delivering actual runtime code changes. May only be closed when the mock is completely removed from the production codebase and verified with tests. | `feat(governance): implement real castVote transaction signing`, `fix: replace lookupToken mock with live Soroban RPC read` |
| **Planning & Spec** | `plan:`, `spec:`, `rfc:`, `Design <X>`, `Architecture for <X>`                               | For architectural designs, ADRs, sequence diagrams, and interface planning. **Never** use "Replace..." or "Wire..." in a planning issue title.                                   | `plan: design Soroban batch transaction signing architecture`, `spec: multi-token liquidity pool error handling`            |
| **Documentation**   | `docs:`, `Document <X>`, `Update <X> guide`                                                  | For updating guides, API references, or status trackers.                                                                                                                         | `docs: document governance contract integration status`, `docs: update deployment runbook for testnet`                      |
| **Audit & Triage**  | `audit:`, `triage:`, `Audit <X> for <Y>`                                                     | For surveys, static analysis, gap analysis, and incident retrospectives. The deliverable is a report doc or inventory, not the fix itself.                                       | `audit: review closed mock-replacement issues for regressions`, `audit: check as-any cast occurrences in components`        |
| **Tracking / Epic** | `tracking:`, `epic:`, `[Epic] <X>`                                                           | Umbrella issues grouping multiple sub-tasks. Must **not** be closed via keyword by a PR resolving only a subset of child issues.                                                 | `tracking: governance live contract integration suite`, `epic: mainnet launch security controls`                            |

These conventions apply to all new issues and PRs going forward and are referenced by this hardening batch (#853–#856).

## Internationalization (i18n)

ILN supports multiple languages using i18next. All user-facing strings must be externalized.

### Adding New Translations

1. **Add strings to translation files**:

   - English: `public/locales/en/translation.json`
   - Spanish: `public/locales/es/translation.json`
   - Add new locales by creating corresponding directories

2. **Use translations in components**:

   ```typescript
   import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

   function MyComponent() {
     const { t } = useTranslation();
     return <h1>{t('common.submit')}</h1>;
   }
   ```

3. **Locale-aware formatting**:
   We provide a custom hook for locale-aware formatting:

   ```typescript
   import { useLocaleFormatting } from '@/hooks/useLocaleFormatting';

   function MyComponent() {
     const { currency, date, percentage, tokenAmount } = useLocaleFormatting();

     // Format currency
     const formatted = currency(1000, 'USD'); // "$1,000.00" or "1.000,00 €"

     // Format date
     const formattedDate = date(new Date(), { dateStyle: 'medium' });

     // Format percentage
     const formattedPercent = percentage(0.05, 2); // "5.00%"

     // Format token amount
     const formattedToken = tokenAmount(1000000000n, 7, 'USDC');
   }
   ```

   Or use the utility functions directly:

   ```typescript
   import { formatCurrency, formatDate } from '@/lib/formatting';

   // Numbers (amounts, percentages)
   const formatted = formatCurrency(1000, 'USD', 'en-US');

   // Dates
   const formattedDate = formatDate(new Date(), { dateStyle: 'medium' }, 'en-US');
   ```

### Adding a New Locale

1. Create locale directory: `public/locales/[locale]/`
2. Copy `translation.json` from English locale
3. Translate all strings
4. Update `src/i18n.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import [locale] from "../public/locales/[locale]/translation.json";

   const resources = {
     en: { translation: en },
     es: { translation: es },
     [locale]: { translation: [locale] },
   };

   supportedLngs: ["en", "es", "[locale]"],
   ```

Then run `pnpm run i18n:check` to confirm the new locale has exactly the same keys as English. CI runs the same check and fails on any missing or extra key.

See the [locale expansion plan](docs/i18n.md#locale-expansion-plan) for how the next locale is chosen and who owns its translations.

### i18n Configuration

The i18n configuration is in `src/i18n.ts`:

- Uses `i18next-browser-languagedetector` for automatic language detection
- Persists language preference in localStorage
- Falls back to English if translation is missing
- Supports English (en) and Spanish (es) out of the box

## MSW API Mocking

Tests use Mock Service Worker (MSW) to mock network calls at the request boundary instead of mocking individual app functions. This makes tests more realistic and maintainable.

### MSW Setup

MSW is configured for both Node (Vitest) and browser (Playwright) environments:

- Server setup: `src/mocks/server.ts`
- Browser setup: `src/mocks/browser.ts`
- Handlers: `src/mocks/handlers.ts`
- Fixtures: `src/mocks/fixtures/`

### Adding New Handlers

1. **Add or update fixtures** in `src/mocks/fixtures/`:

   ```typescript
   // src/mocks/fixtures/contract.ts
   export const myNewFixture = {
     // realistic API response data
   };
   ```

2. **Add request handler** in `src/mocks/handlers.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw';
   import { myNewFixture } from './fixtures/contract';

   export const handlers = [
     http.get('https://api.example.com/endpoint', () => {
       return HttpResponse.json(myNewFixture);
     }),
   ];
   ```

3. **Use in tests**:

   ```typescript
   import { server } from '@/mocks/server';

   describe('MyComponent', () => {
     it('should handle API response', () => {
       server.use(
         http.get('https://api.example.com/endpoint', () => {
           return HttpResponse.json({ custom: 'response' });
         })
       );
       // test logic
     });
   });
   ```

### Existing Handlers

Current MSW handlers cover:

- Horizon account/balance endpoints
- Horizon transaction endpoints
- Friendbot faucet endpoint
- CoinGecko price endpoint
- Soroban RPC contract calls
- Internal API endpoints (leaderboard, notifications)

### Migrating from Function Mocks

When migrating existing tests from function mocks to MSW:

1. Identify mocked functions (e.g., `jest.fn()`, `vi.fn()`)
2. Replace with MSW handlers that intercept the actual network request
3. Remove function mock imports and setup
4. Verify tests still pass with realistic network responses

Example migration:

```typescript
// Before (function mock)
vi.mock('@/lib/horizonClient', () => ({
  fetchNativeXlmBalance: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(1000),
}));

// After (MSW handler)
import { server } from '@/mocks/server';

server.use(
  http.get('https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/accounts/:accountId', () => {
    return HttpResponse.json({
      balances: [{ asset_type: 'native', balance: '1000' }],
    });
  })
);
```

## Visual Regression Testing with Chromatic

This project uses Chromatic for visual regression testing to catch unintended UI changes before they reach production.

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up Chromatic project:**
   - Create an account at [chromatic.com](https://chromatic.com)
   - Link your GitHub repository
   - Get your project token from the Chromatic dashboard
   - Add the token to your environment: `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN=your_token_here`

### Running Visual Tests

#### Local Development

```bash
# Start Storybook locally
npm run storybook

# Build Storybook for production
npm run build-storybook

# Run Chromatic visual tests
npm run chromatic
```

#### CI/CD Integration

Visual regression tests run automatically on:

- Pull requests from maintainers (with access to repository secrets)
- Pushes to main branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Note for first-time contributors**: Visual regression tests are skipped for fork PRs because they require the `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` secret, which is not available to forks. When the Chromatic check is skipped, you'll see a clear notice in the PR checks explaining why. Your code will still be tested by other CI checks (linting, unit tests, E2E tests). A maintainer will review visual changes when merging your PR.

### Approval Workflow

#### When Visual Changes Are Detected

1. **Review Changes:**

   - Chromatic will comment on your PR with a link to review changes
   - Click the link to see before/after comparisons
   - Review each component change carefully

2. **Approve Intentional Changes:**

   - If changes are intentional (new features, design updates):
     - Click "Accept" for each intended change in Chromatic
     - Add a comment explaining the change
   - If changes are unintentional:
     - Click "Deny" and fix the issue in your code
     - Push new commits to update the visual tests

3. **Baseline Updates:**
   - Approved changes become the new baseline
   - Future tests will compare against these new baselines
   - Only maintainers can approve changes on the main branch

#### Best Practices

1. **Component Stories:**

   - Write comprehensive stories covering all component states
   - Include edge cases (loading, error, empty states)
   - Test different prop combinations
   - Use realistic data in stories

2. **Responsive Testing:**

   - Test components at different viewport sizes
   - Include mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
   - Use Storybook's viewport addon for consistent testing

3. **Accessibility:**

   - All stories are automatically tested with axe-core
   - Fix accessibility violations before merging
   - Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes

4. **Performance:**
   - Keep stories lightweight and focused
   - Avoid heavy computations in story renders
   - Use mock data instead of real API calls

### Story Writing Guidelines

#### File Structure

```
src/components/
├── Button/
│   ├── Button.tsx
│   ├── Button.stories.tsx
│   └── Button.test.tsx
```

#### Story Template

```typescript
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';
import { ComponentName } from './ComponentName';

const meta: Meta<typeof ComponentName> = {
  title: 'Components/ComponentName',
  component: ComponentName,
  parameters: {
    layout: 'centered', // or 'padded', 'fullscreen'
  },
  tags: ['autodocs'],
  argTypes: {
    // Define controls for props
  },
};

export default meta;
type Story = StoryObj<typeof meta>;

export const Default: Story = {
  args: {
    // Default props
  },
};

export const Variant: Story = {
  args: {
    // Variant props
  },
};
```

### Required Stories for Key Components

#### High Priority Components

- [ ] `Button` - All variants, sizes, states
- [ ] `InvoiceStatusBadge` - All status types
- [ ] `RiskBadge` - All risk levels
- [ ] `DataTable` - Loading, empty, populated states
- [ ] `TokenSelector` - All token types, error states

#### Medium Priority Components

- [ ] `InvoiceTable` - Different data sets, filters
- [ ] `LPPortfolio` - Various portfolio states
- [ ] `NotificationBell` - Read/unread states
- [ ] `Modal` components - Open/closed states
- [ ] `Form` components - Valid/invalid states

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **Flaky Tests:**

   - Use `chromatic --exit-zero-on-changes` for non-blocking tests
   - Add delays for animations: `parameters: { chromatic: { delay: 300 } }`
   - Disable animations in test environment

2. **Large Diffs:**

   - Check for font loading issues
   - Ensure consistent test environment
   - Use fixed dimensions for dynamic content

3. **Missing Baselines:**
   - Run `npm run chromatic` on main branch first
   - Ensure all stories are properly exported
   - Check Storybook build for errors

#### Getting Help

- Check the [Chromatic documentation](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/)
- Review existing stories for patterns
- Ask in the team Slack channel for guidance
- Create an issue for persistent problems

### Maintenance

#### Regular Tasks

- Review and approve visual changes weekly
- Update baselines after major design changes
- Archive old unused stories
- Monitor Chromatic usage and costs

#### Version Updates

- Test Storybook updates in a separate branch
- Regenerate all baselines after major updates
- Update this documentation as needed

## Getting Help

If you need help:

- Check existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Frontend/issues)
- Review the [architecture documentation](docs/architecture.md)
- Read the [design system guide](DESIGN.md)
- Join community discussions (link to Discord/Slack if available)

## Code Review and Code Owners

This project uses a [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) file to automatically request reviews from maintainers based on which files are changed in a pull request.

### Ownership Rationale

The following areas have designated code owners to ensure consistent review and maintainability:

- **Core React hooks** (`src/hooks/`): Wallet integration, contract interactions, and data fetching logic require deep understanding of the application's reactive architecture.
- **React Context providers** (`src/context/`): Global state management and wallet context are critical infrastructure that affect the entire application.
- **API routes** (`app/api/`): Backend endpoints handle authentication, data APIs, and server-side logic that require security and performance considerations.
- **GitHub Actions workflows** (`.github/workflows/`): CI/CD pipelines, testing, and deployment configurations need careful review to prevent breaking changes.
- **Governance utilities** (`src/utils/governance.ts`): Voting and proposal management logic is domain-specific and requires governance expertise.
- **Contract layer** (`src/lib/soroban.ts`, `src/lib/horizon.ts`, `src/lib/indexer-websocket.ts`): Stellar SDK integration, transaction signing, and indexer connections are critical blockchain infrastructure.
- **Core constants and configuration** (`src/constants.ts`): Central configuration affects the entire application and requires careful review.
- **Type definitions** (`src/types/`): TypeScript types define the contract for the entire codebase.
- **Documentation** (`docs/`): Documentation changes require review to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### How It Works

When you open a PR, GitHub will automatically suggest reviewers based on the files you've changed. This helps ensure that:

- Changes to critical infrastructure get appropriate review
- Domain experts review changes in their areas of expertise
- Review turnaround time is improved by routing to the right people
- Knowledge is distributed across the team

### Adding New Code Owners

If you become a regular contributor to a specific area of the codebase, you can request to be added as a code owner. Contact a maintainer to discuss this.

## Stale Assignment Policy

To maintain effective Wave throughput and ensure issues don't get claimed and abandoned, this repository uses an automated stale assignment reclaimer.

### How It Works

The stale assignment bot runs daily and monitors assigned issues:

1. **Warning Stage (7 days of inactivity)**

   - If an issue has been assigned for 7+ days with no linked PR activity, a warning comment is added
   - The issue is labeled with `stale-assignment-warning`
   - The assignee is notified with instructions to either:
     - Open a draft PR
     - Comment with a progress update
     - Unassign themselves if no longer working on it

2. **Reclaim Stage (14 days of inactivity)**
   - If no activity is detected for 14+ days, the assignment is automatically removed
   - The issue is labeled with `assignment-reclaimed`
   - Other contributors can then claim the issue

### Configuration

The timeout periods are configurable in `.github/workflows/stale-assignments.yml`:

- `WARNING_DAYS`: Days before warning comment (default: 7)
- `RECLAIM_DAYS`: Days before unassignment (default: 14)

### For Contributors

- **When claiming an issue**: Open a draft PR within 7 days to show active work
- **If you need more time**: Comment on the issue with a progress update to reset the timer
- **If you can't complete it**: Unassign yourself promptly so others can claim it
- **After reclamation**: If your assignment was reclaimed but you're still working on it, re-assign yourself and open a PR promptly

### Exemptions

Issues with linked open PRs are automatically exempt from the stale assignment check.

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We aim to create a welcoming environment for all contributors.
